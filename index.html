<h1> Keep Coding: 7 Tips to Keep Your Motivation – Even When It Gets Tough </h1>

<h2>Motivation & tips to help you learn to code for free </h2>


<p>
<h3>1. Know why you want to code</h3>
As with any journey, you need to know your why before taking a plunge into coding. <br /> Having some fun,
stimulating your
mind, gaining an edge at work, or even starting a career in software engineering — your reason could be anything.
<br /> What
matters is that you’re crystal clear on what it is. If you can figure that out, you’ll have a powerful purpose to
fall
back on when the next time motivation goes down.
</p>
<p>
<h3>2. Define your coding goal and visualize it</h3>
<br /> Just like knowing your why is the first step of any journey, defining your one big goal is the first step
towards
achieving it. The key here is to make it as specific as you can. <br /> For example, learning how to create a
website using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within the next four weeks.
</p>
<p>
<h3>3. Once you’ve defined your goal, you need to visualize it. </h3>
<br /> Take a deep breath and imagine yourself working
towards
that
goal. <br /> Imagine what it feels like. See what the end looks like. <br /> Visualization might seem silly at
first, but research
has
shown that you can improve any skill just by visualizing yourself practicing it.
